### A [Bangkit 2021](https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit/) Capstone Project

Kestrel is a TensorFlow powered American Sign Language translator Android app that would make it easier for everyone to seamlessly communicate with people who have eyesight or hearing disabilities. Kestrel's model builds upon the state of the art MobileNetV2 model that is optimized for speed and latency on smartphones to recognize and interpret sign language from the phoneâ€™s camera accurately and display its translation through a beautiful, convenient and easily accessible Android app.
