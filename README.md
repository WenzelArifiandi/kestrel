# Kestrel
### A [Bangkit 2021](https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit/) Capstone Project

Kestrel is a TensorFlow powered sign language translator Android app that will make it easier for anyone to seamlessly communicate with people who have hearing impairments. The Kestrel model builds upon the state of the art MobileNetV2 model that is optimized for speed and latency on mobile devices to accurately recognize and interpret sign language from the phoneâ€™s camera and display its translation through a beautiful, convenient and easily accessible Android app.
